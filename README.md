# WIDS--Fake-News-Detector
This repository contains a basic description and code written in the 4-week long WIDS Fake News Detector project 2025.

The work progresses from foundational concepts (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, GitHub) to core ML theory (supervised learning, classification, evaluation metrics) and NLP techniques such as text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier, are implemented and evaluated for fake news detection. In the final stage, the trained model is serialized using Joblib and deployed as a simple interactive web application using Gradio, allowing users to input news text and receive real-time predictions.

All weekly assignments completed during the course of the program are attached in this repository for reference and evaluation.
