# WIDS--Fake-News-Detector
This repository contains a basic description and code written in the 4-week long WIDS Fake News Detector project 2025
The work progresses from foundational concepts (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, GitHub) to core ML theory (supervised learning, classification, evaluation metrics) and NLP techniques such as text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier, are implemented and evaluated for fake news detection.

All weekly assignments completed during the course of the program are attached in this repository for reference and evaluation.
